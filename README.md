## UCSD MGT171 group project

In game one, our strategic focus was maintaining moderate utilization rates. By constantly monitoring these rates, our team was able to effectively manage resources and swiftly address and rectify any bottlenecks that arose, ensuring operational fluidity. A collaborative approach was embraced for decision-making processes to avoid overreactions to minor fluctuations. This strategy saw the allocation of four machines to station 1, two to station 2, and three to station 3, which translated into significant success. However, the strategy was not without its flaws; the most notable was indecision. Our inability to accurately forecast consumer numbers or anticipate shifts in these numbers meant opportunities to optimize through the acquisition or disposal of machines were missed, leading to minor losses due to delayed reactions. Despite these challenges, the chosen strategy predominantly manifested as an efficacious approach.
